Anchor Group is a Jupyter Notebook to help engineers calculate the volume of anchor group cones using python.

The script has been set up for 90 degree cones at a regular grid spacing, however modifying the code slightly will allow for 60 degree cones or for irregularly spaced anchors.

To access the notebook online click one of the buttons up top.
